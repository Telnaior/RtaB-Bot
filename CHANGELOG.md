2.0.1
 - CRITICAL bugfix to allow the same minigame to be played in multiple channels simultaneously without breaking things.
 - All previous multi-channel releases can be considered broken if the multi-channel functionality is used.

 - Excess Boost past the cap (in either direction) now (silently) converts into cash

 - Board distribution adjusted - more minigames, fewer events, and no jokers in small games, while more cash and fewer minigames in large games

 - Bombs now detonate automatically at the end of the game (both showing you where they were, and adding them to the win bonus)
 - Event Weights adjusted (unsurprisingly)

 - New Events: Double Deal, Boost Charger, Boost Magnet Midas Touch, Ejector Seat, Skip Turn, Reverse, Draw Two, Draw Four
 - Removed Events: Scramble, Repeat, Minigame Lock

 - Lockdown now acts as Triple Deal as well
 - Split & Share now hands out 2% per living player at the time you explode, rather than a flat 10% shared between everyone
 - Mystery Money is rarer, has a 10% chance to give you negative cash, and shows up in Lockdown now
 - Jackpot scales to the playercount, awarding $1m for each space originally on the board
 - End Round renamed to Final Countdown and put on a delay
